# Splurty

Splurty was built with Ruby on Rails 5.2.1 when I was a student at Vanderbilt University's Coding Boot Camp. It lets users input quotes and they are randomly put out everytime the page is refreshed. These quotes are stored in the pages database.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
